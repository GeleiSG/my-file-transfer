A cozy dining nook with a round wooden table and four high-backed chairs, set against a backdrop of a window with white blinds and a calendar board displaying pictures of paris and rome. a framed landscape painting adds to the room's ambiance. at the two-second mark, the scene shifts to a kitchen corner with a wooden dining set, a white changing table with a blue pad, and a potted plant. a stainless steel toaster and a bowl of oranges are on the countertop, with a window providing natural light and a view of greenery outside.
