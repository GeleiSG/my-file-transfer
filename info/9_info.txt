A modern bathroom with a beige vanity, a large mirror, and a window with white blinds. a white toilet is also present, and the room is decorated with three ornate wall pieces. at the two-second mark, the scene shifts to a bedroom with light grey walls, dark hardwood floors, and a white bedspread. an open door reveals a walk-in closet with a black desk and an ergonomic chair, a sleek lamp, and a small plant. the room is well-lit by a chandelier and natural light.
